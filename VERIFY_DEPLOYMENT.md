# Post-Deployment Verification Checklist

Once the deployment completes, you'll receive a URL like: `https://am-kelavi-benefits-xxxxx.vercel.app`

## 1. Test Frontend Loading
- [ ] Visit the main URL - the page should load without errors
- [ ] Check browser console (F12) for any JavaScript errors
- [ ] Verify the Hebrew text displays correctly
- [ ] Check that the page shows "טוען..." (loading) initially

## 2. Test API Endpoints Directly

Replace `YOUR-URL` with your actual Vercel deployment URL:

- [ ] Health Check: `https://YOUR-URL/api/health`
  - Should return: `{"status":"healthy","message":"AM-Kelavi Benefits API is running","timestamp":"..."}`

- [ ] Categories: `https://YOUR-URL/api/categories`
  - Should return: `{"success":true,"categories":[...]}`

- [ ] All Benefits: `https://YOUR-URL/api/benefits`
  - Should return: `{"success":true,"data":[...],"count":X}`

- [ ] Search: `https://YOUR-URL/api/search?q=test`
  - Should return filtered results

## 3. Test Frontend Functionality

- [ ] Categories load and display
- [ ] Clicking a category filters the benefits
- [ ] Search box works
- [ ] "קרא עוד" (Read more) button opens modal
- [ ] External links work
- [ ] Clearing search/filters shows all benefits again

## 4. Check Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Check the Functions tab for any errors
4. Review the deployment logs if issues occur

## Common Issues & Solutions

### If you get 404 errors:
- Check that all files were deployed (look in Vercel dashboard)
- Verify the API routes match exactly (case-sensitive)

### If you get 500 errors:
- Check Function logs in Vercel dashboard
- Look for missing dependencies or syntax errors

### If frontend loads but no data:
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify API endpoints are returning data
- Check Network tab in browser DevTools

## Success Indicators

✅ Homepage loads without errors
✅ Categories appear
✅ Benefits load and display
✅ Search functionality works
✅ No console errors
✅ All API endpoints return valid JSON

## Next Steps if Everything Works
